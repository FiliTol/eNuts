⚠️ **Caution: The following information pertains to an untested DB layer. Use at your own risk.**

Please be aware that the entire db (database) layer of this system has not undergone thorough testing. This means that the functionality and performance of this particular layer have not been verified, and there may be unforeseen issues or bugs present.

The untested db layer poses potential risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:

    Data integrity: There is a possibility of data corruption, loss, or inconsistency due to unverified interactions with the db layer.
    Performance issues: The untested db layer might have suboptimal performance characteristics, such as slow query execution or inefficient resource utilization.
    Compatibility problems: Interoperability issues might arise when integrating with other components or services that rely on the db layer.
    Security vulnerabilities: The untested db layer might contain security weaknesses, exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access.

Remember that the use of this untested db layer is entirely at your discretion, and the developers, contributors, or maintainers of this software cannot be held liable for any damages, losses, or adverse effects arising from its usage.

If you choose to proceed with the untested db layer, exercise extreme caution and consider seeking expert advice or assistance to mitigate potential risks effectively.

Please note that this warning should be taken seriously and should not be ignored or underestimated.

Thank you for your understanding and attention to this matter.

# Run Dev Environment

eNuts is built using the managed workflow provided by Expo, so the
easiest way to run a development environment is their
[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.

## Spin up your dev server

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate inside the repository and run `npm install`
3. Start the Expo dev server by running `npm run start`

## Connect your Expo Go app

1. Download the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
2. Scan the QR code provided by your dev server's terminal using the app (iOS
